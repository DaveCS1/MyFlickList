[MyFlickList](https://myflicklist.netlify.app) is a social cataloging platform where users can rate movies and TV shows they have watched, get recommendations, share their lists with friends, discuss related topics, and more. This website is inspired by similar projects, such as [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net), [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com), and others.
